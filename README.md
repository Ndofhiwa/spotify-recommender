## Abstract

This project implements a comprehensive music recommendation system that integrates with Spotify's API to provide personalized song suggestions and automated playlist generation. The system employs content-based filtering using audio features and cosine similarity metrics to recommend musically similar tracks. Built with Python and Streamlit, the application demonstrates modern web development practices, API integration, and machine learning implementation for practical music discovery.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Overview
The Spotify Music Recommender is a web application that helps users discover new music based on their existing preferences. By analyzing audio characteristics and musical patterns, the system suggests songs that share similar acoustic properties, enabling personalized music exploration beyond traditional genre-based recommendations.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
With over 100 million tracks available on streaming platforms, users face overwhelming choice when searching for new music. Existing recommendation algorithms often rely heavily on collaborative filtering, which struggles with new or niche content. This project addresses these limitations through content-based analysis of intrinsic musical features.

### 1.3 Objectives
- Develop a content-based music recommendation engine using Spotify's audio features
- Create an intuitive user interface for music discovery and playlist management
- Implement secure OAuth 2.0 authentication with Spotify API
- Provide analytical insights into musical preferences and library characteristics
- Demonstrate scalable software architecture with proper separation of concerns

## 2. System Architecture

3. Algorithm Design and Implementation

3.1 Recommendation Algorithm

3.1.1 Feature Selection

The system utilizes Spotify's comprehensive audio features:

· Danceability: Rhythmic suitability (0.0 to 1.0)
· Energy: Intensity and activity measure (0.0 to 1.0)
· Valence: Musical positiveness (0.0 to 1.0)
· Acousticness: Confidence of acoustic nature (0.0 to 1.0)
· Instrumentalness: Likelihood of no vocals (0.0 to 1.0)
· Tempo: Beats per minute (BPM)
· Loudness: Overall volume in decibels
· Speechiness: Presence of spoken words (0.0 to 1.0)

3.1.2 Similarity Calculation

python
def compute_similarity(target_features, all_features):
    # Standardize features
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    features_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(all_features)
    
    # Compute cosine similarity
    similarity_scores = cosine_similarity(
        target_features.reshape(1, -1), 
        features_scaled
    )
    return similarity_scores[0]


3.1.3 Algorithm Complexity

· Feature Scaling: O(n×d) where n is number of songs, d is features
· Similarity Computation: O(n×d) for cosine similarity
· Overall Complexity: O(n×d) suitable for datasets up to 10,000 songs

        self.feature_matrix = self._extract_features()
        self.song_index = self._build_index()
